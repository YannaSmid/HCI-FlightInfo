Guide
After the software has been succesfully installed, you can clone this repository and open the 'HCI Flight Information Display' folder in unity. 
To do this, open Unity Hub and add this folder to your projects. Once this project has been added you can open the folder.
Plug in the Leap Motion device into your computer. 
Make sure that the program starts with the Menu scene for a full experience of the system. If the current scene is not the Menu scene, then this scene can be found and opened by going to Assets>Scenes and then dubble click on the scene called 'Menu'. 
Start the program by pressing the play icon above the scene view.
