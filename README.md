# HCI-FlightInfo
This is a project for Human Computer Interaction & Information Visualization. In this project information about different flight routes are visualised on a 3D globe. 
People are able to interact with this system via Leap Motion controls. 
The Ultraleap Hand Tracking Software (V5.2+) needs to be installed before you are able to use the program. This software can be dowloaded via this link: https://grasshopper-kale-khsa.squarespace.com/tracking-software-download .
